		<h2>HARD ROCK</h2>

	<p><span class="bold">Hard rock</span> is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with keyboards.</p>
<p>
Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with bands such as <span class="bold"> the Who, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Aerosmith, Kiss, Queen, AC/DC and Van Halen</span>. During the 1980s, some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock. Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and it reached a commercial peak in the 1980s, with glam metal bands like <span class="bold"> Bon Jovi</span>, and <span class="bold"> Def Leppard</span> and the rawer sounds of <span class="bold"> Guns N' Roses</span>, which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade. Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of R&B, hip-hop, urban pop, grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s.</p>
<p>
Despite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a hard rock sound and in the 2000s there came a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like <span class="bold"> the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol</span> and, later on, <span class="bold"> the Black Keys</span>. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.</p>
